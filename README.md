# Lox

A learning project, Lox contains implementations of the Lox programming language.  It includes both jlox and clox, as detailed in Robert Nystrom's [*Crafting Interpreters*](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

Beyond that, it will also contain glox, a golang implementation.  Ideally, these implementations will contain some features (like static typing and a barebones standard library) that are not included in Nystrom's book.  

Following glox, I intend to write a complete llvm front-end for lox so that lox code can be compiled into binary executables.  I suppose there will also be unit-tests and some benchmarks comparing the implementations.

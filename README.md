# Lox

A learning project, Lox contains implementations of the Lox programming language.  It includes both jlox and clox, as detailed in Robert Nystrom's *Crafting Interpreters*.  

Beyond that, it will also contain glox, a golang implementation.  Ideally, these implementations will contain some features (like static typing and a barebones standard library) that are not included in Nystrom's book.

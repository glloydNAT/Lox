# Lox
Implementations of the Lox programming language.  Includes both jlox and clox from Robert Nystrom's 'Crafting Interpreters'.  Ideally, it will also contain glox, a golang implementation.  Also ideally, these implementations will contain some features (like static typing and a barebones standard library) that are not included in Nystrom's book.
